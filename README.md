**An open protocol enabling communication and interoperability between opaque agentic applications.**

The Agent2Agent (A2A) protocol addresses a critical challenge in the AI landscape: enabling gen AI agents, built on diverse frameworks by different companies running on separate servers, to communicate and collaborate effectively - as agents, not just as tools. A2A aims to provide a common language for agents, fostering a more interconnected, powerful, and innovative AI ecosystem.

With A2A, agents can:

- Discover each other's capabilities.
- Negotiate interaction modalities (text, forms, media).
- Securely collaborate on long running tasks.
- Operate without exposing their internal state, memory, or tools.

## See A2A in Action

Watch [this demo video](https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-developer-goog-blog-assets/original_videos/A2A_demo_v4.mp4) to see how A2A enables seamless communication between different agent frameworks.

## Why A2A?

As AI agents become more prevalent, their ability to interoperate is crucial for building complex, multi-functional applications. A2A aims to:

- **Break Down Silos:** Connect agents across different ecosystems.
- **Enable Complex Collaboration:** Allow specialized agents to work together on tasks that a single agent cannot handle alone.
- **Promote Open Standards:** Foster a community-driven approach to agent communication, encouraging innovation and broad adoption.
- **Preserve Opacity:** Allow agents to collaborate without needing to share internal memory, proprietary logic, or specific tool implementations, enhancing security and protecting intellectual property.

### Key Features

- **Standardized Communication:** JSON-RPC 2.0 over HTTP(S).
- **Agent Discovery:** Via "Agent Cards" detailing capabilities and connection info.
- **Flexible Interaction:** Supports synchronous request/response, streaming (SSE), and asynchronous push notifications.
- **Rich Data Exchange:** Handles text, files, and structured JSON data.
- **Enterprise-Ready:** Designed with security, authentication, and observability in mind.

## What's next

### Protocol Enhancements

- **Agent Discovery:**
    - Formalize inclusion of authorization schemes and optional credentials directly within the `AgentCard`.
- **Agent Collaboration:**
    - Investigate a `QuerySkill()` method for dynamically checking unsupported or unanticipated skills.
- **Task Lifecycle & UX:**
    - Support for dynamic UX negotiation _within_ a task (e.g., agent adding audio/video mid-conversation).
- **Client Methods & Transport:**
    - Explore extending support to client-initiated methods (beyond task management).
    - Improvements to streaming reliability and push notification mechanisms.
